# Challenge Title
Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue

## Approach & Efficiency
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.
- Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated
  - This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
- Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
 - This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.

## Run The Code
```
python3 python/stack_and_queue/stack.py 
python3 python/stack_and_queue/queue.py
```
[Open Stack code](./queue.py)

[Open Queue code](./queue.py)
